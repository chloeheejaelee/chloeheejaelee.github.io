            <h1>What is Terraform?</h1>
                <p>Similar to Bash, Terraform is also an open-source infrastructure as code software tool. This allows DevOps engineers to programmatically provision the physical resources an application requires to run. This allows IT users to logically monitor, provision, and manage resources compared to having the operation team manually edit each resource. Terraform uses a JSON-like configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). Through this language, DevOps have an easier handle on supplying new or updated infrastructure across multiple clouds and data centers.</p>
            <h1>How does Terraform work</h1>
                <p>Terraform works by allowing users to configure files and version control through the entire infrastructure. Users will give a command to deploy and run a server, Terraform then parses that code and transfers it to an API call to the resource provider. The benefits of having this as an open source tool is by allowing developers to write new plugins or compiling different versions of existing plugins.</p>
            <h1><b>Terraform has two important components: </b></h1>
            <h1>Terraform Core</h1>
                <p>The reading and interpolation of resource plan executions, resource graphs, state management features, and configuration files is handled by Terraform Core. Compiled binaries built in the Go programming language make up Core. Every compiled binary serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with plugins via remote procedure calls (RPC).</p>
            <h1>Terraform Plugins</h1>
                <p>Terraform Plugins are in charge of specifying resources for certain Terraform services. This includes establishing trust with infrastructure providers and setting up the libraries that will be used to make API requests. Terraform Plugins are executable binaries written in Go that may be used as either a specialized service or a provisioner. (Provisioner plugins are used to run commands against a specific resource.)</p>               
            <h1>Things Terraforms are used for</h1>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>External resource management: </b>Terraform can deploy public and private cloud infrastructure, network appliances, and software as a service (SaaS) applications.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Multi-cloud deployment: </b>The capacity of the software product to support different cloud services out of the box helps to boost fault tolerance.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Multi-tier application: </b>Terraform allows each resource collection to easily be scaled up or down as needed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Self-service clusters: </b>The registries make it easy for users to find prepackaged configurations that can be used as is or modified to meet a particular need</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Software defined networking (SDN): </b>The readability of Terraform makes it simple for network engineers to codify SDN setup.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Resource Scheduler: </b>Terraform modules allow Kubernetes to schedule Docker containers and can stop and start resources on AWS.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Disposable environments: </b>Before code is put into production, modules can be used to construct an ad hoc, throwaway test environment.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
