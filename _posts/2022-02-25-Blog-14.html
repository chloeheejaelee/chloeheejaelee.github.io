            <h1>What is Boostrap?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Bootstrap is a web development framework that is both free and open-source. It's intended to make the building of responsive, mobile-first websites easier by providing a set of template design syntax. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>                
            <h1>Why Boostrap?</h1>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Ease of Use: </b>Boostrap is easy to understand. Because of its popularity, there are numerous tutorials and online forums to assist you in getting started.The fact that Bootstrap has a basic file structure is one of the reasons why it is so popular among web developers and designers. Its files are assembled for simple access, and changing them only requires a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS. Themes for popular content management systems can also be used as instructional aids. Most WordPress themes, for example, were created with Bootstrap, which is available to even the most inexperienced web developer.Bootstrap minifies the CSS and JavaScript files to speed up the page load time. Additionally, Bootstrap ensures that the syntax of websites and developers is consistent, which is perfect for collaborative projects.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Responsive Grid: </b>Bootstrap comes includes a built-in grid system, which eliminates the need to create one from scratch. Instead of adding media queries in the CSS file, the grid system uses rows and columns to create a grid within an existing one. Additionally, the grid architecture in Bootstrap simplifies the data entry procedure. It has a number of media queries in it, so you may build custom breakpoints for each column based on your web project requirements. In most cases, the default settings are sufficient. After you've created a grid, all you have to do now is fill the containers with content. To better support both desktop and mobile-based projects, the Bootstrap grid system features two container classes: a fixed container (.container) and a fluid container (.fluid) (.container-fluid).</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Browser Compatibility: </b>Making your website accessible via different browsers helps reduce the bounce rate and rank higher in search results. Bootstrap fulfills that requirement by being compatible with the latest versions of popular browsers. Despite not supporting lesser-known browsers like WebKit and Gecko, websites with Bootstrap should function correctly on them as well. However, there may be limitations regarding modals and dropdowns on smaller screens.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Bootstrap Image System: </b>A unidirectional data flow is followed by React. As a result, developers frequently nest child components within parent components when developing a React app. Because data flows in a single path, debugging faults and determining where a problem arises in an application at any given time becomes easier.</p>
