            <h1>What is Windows?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Microsoft's Windows operating system is a graphical operating system. It lets users view and save files, run applications, play games, and watch videos, as well as connect to the internet. It was made available for both personal and professional use. The original version, 1.0, was released by Microsoft. On November 10, 1983, it was published for both home computer and professional functions of Windows. It was later available on a variety of Windows versions, including the current version, Windows 11. Microsoft created the various versions of Windows XP for a home and commercial context when it was released in 2001. It was built using common x86 hardware, such as Intel and AMD processors. Accordingly, it can run on different brands of hardware, such as HP, Dell, and Sony computers, including home-built PCs. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Simply put, gaming on Windows is superior. Thousands of games are available for the current Windows version, and accessing and keeping them up to date is straightforward. â€¦ Mods that change the game's aesthetics, gameplay mechanics, and even the genre of the original game are readily available.</p>

            <h1>Disadvantages of Windows</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Complicated: </b>Some users may find Windows 10 to be challenging. This is due to the fact that it is quite powerful and offers a wide range of functions. The fact is that it is easier to use than Linux, and while macOS is simple to use, it is just as complicated as Windows if you want to do anything fancy; Apple simply ignores this aspect of their marketing strategy. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Viruses and Malware: </b> I'm not going to lie: there are a lot more viruses and malware for Windows out there. Do you have any idea why? The reason for this is that Windows is so widely used. Sure, macOS and Linux aren't a problem, but because they're installed on so few devices, virus writers don't bother, albeit that's changing.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><p><b>Bugs and Issues: </b> Many individuals are dissatisfied with Windows because of bugs and other issues. There are bugs, to be sure. But guess what? Other operating systems contain problems as well. It's just a feature of the software. Apple, like Windows and Linux, is constantly patching their operating system. Of course, due of its ubiquity, you'll hear more about Windows bugs.
