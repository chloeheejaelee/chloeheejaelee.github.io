            <h1>What is Android?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Android is a touchscreen mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, built primarily for smartphones and tablets. Google commercially sponsors Android, which is created by a group of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance. The majority of Android versions are proprietary. The Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is free and open-source software (FOSS) largely distributed under the Apache License, provided the essential components. When Android is installed on a device, the ability to modify the normally FOSS software is frequently limited, either by not giving the source code or by blocking reinstallation through technical means, thereby making the installed version proprietary. Most Android devices come pre-installed with additional proprietary software, the most notable of which is Google Mobile Services, which comprises important programs like Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play, and the Google Play Services development platform. The source code has been used to create Android variations for a variety of other devices, including gaming consoles, digital cameras, portable media players, and personal computers, each with its own user interface. Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables, both created by Google, are two well-known versions. On Android, software packages in the APK format are typically distributed through proprietary app stores such as Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, Samsung Galaxy Store, Huawei AppGallery, Cafe Bazaar, and GetJar, as well as open source platforms such as Aptoide or F-Droid. Since 2011, Android has been the most popular smartphone and tablet operating system in the world. It has over three billion monthly active users as of May 2021, the largest installed base of any operating system, and the Google Play Store has over three million apps as of January 2021. The most recent version, Android 12, was launched on October 4, 2021. </p>

             <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
                 <ul>
                     <li>
                         <p><b>Runs slow on low-specification devices:</b> Android operating system is huge and takes up a lot of storage. So phones with low hardware specifications run slow on this OS. Not only does it run slow because of low hardware but it also comes iwth several default apps that further slow down the smartphone operation. This causes no scope of downloading external apps and also leads to hearing issues of the device. </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         <p><b>Doesnâ€™t offer premium virus protection:</b> Android devices do not come with built-in virus protection like Apple devices, therefore users must download anti-virus software to keep their devices safe. Many apps in the Google Play Store may have viruses that damage the device's functionality. </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>

                     <li>
                         <p><b>Often apps are bad quality disappointing users:</b> Because their sole objective is to raise money through ad display, many apps on the Play Store are of poor quality and provide a terrible user experience. You might also come across a few apps that haven't been updated in years and end up interfering with the newly installed operating system.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         <p><b>Google account mandatory to use Play Store:</b> Because Android is a Google product, you'll need a Google account to access the Play Store and sync with other Google users' devices.</p>
