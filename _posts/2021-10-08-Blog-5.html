            <h1>What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
                <p>Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. The services it provides include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence all over the cloud. So instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, the users can now access technology services on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and much more.</p>
            <h1>Benefits</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Cost: </b>Since cloud computing covers all hardware and software expenses, electricity to power and cool, setting up and running datacenters that houses multiple racks of servers and on demand IT experts that help manage the infrastructure.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Speed: </b>Computing resources are provisioned in minutes to offer users a lot of flexibility and help ease the burden of capacity planning.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Global Scale: </b>Provides the ability to deliver the right amount of IT resources; Scale Elastically. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Productivity: </b>Cloud computing removes the need of setting up hardware setups, software patching and other chores. This makes it so IT teams can focus on more important tasks.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Performance: </b>Since they maintain the upgrades to the hardware, this means that users will always have the most reduced network latency and greater economies of scale. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Reliability: </b>Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Security: </b>Multiple cloud providers also offer a broad set of policies that help strengthen the user’s security and help protect important information.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>                
            <h1>Types of Cloud Computing</h1>
                <p>There are many different types of demands on cloud computing. Some want to completely customize their own infrastructure while others would like to pay for someone else to maintain their information. So there are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud.</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Public cloud: </b>Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, which delivers their computer resources, like servers and storage, over the Internet. Users can access these services through a web browser.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Private cloud: </b>Private clouds are exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on a company’s data center. These are often maintained on a private network. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Hybrid cloud: </b>Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds, where information can be sent between them. This allows for more flexibility and deployment options, and helps optimize the user’s infrastructure, security and compliance. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Types of Cloud Services: </h1>
                <p>Each business has different levels of how they would like to scale their business and to understand the differences will help the business become more efficient. There are 4 different types: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): </b>A method that provides network resources such as for storage and allow the client to deploy software and add network components such as firewalls. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Ex: </b>AWS (you can manage the server)</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS): </b>A method that enables infrastructure and tools from the service provider so that the client does not need to manage them. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Ex: </b>Go Daddy (Can upload a bunch of website code and basically point domain name to it)</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Software as a Service (SaaS): </b>Services for delivering and providing access to software remotely as a web-base service</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Ex: </b>Gmail (All you manage is your inbox. Google takes care of the data center. All you worry about is the software itself and how you want to use it)</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
