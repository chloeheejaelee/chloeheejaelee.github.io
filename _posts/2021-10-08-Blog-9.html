            <h1>What is Cryptography?</h1>
                <p>Cryptography is a means of using codes to protect information and communications so that only those who are supposed to read and process it may do so.</p>
                <p>Cryptography is a term used in computer science to describe secure information and communication techniques that use mathematical principles and a series of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to change communications in difficult-to-decipher ways. These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signature, data privacy verification, online browsing, and private communications including credit card transactions and email.</p>
            <h1>Basic Understanding of Cryptography</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Professionals that are known to work with cryptography are known as cryptographers. In order to familiarize yourself with the basics of cryptography, most people have to understand that cryptography is basically scrambling plaintext (common text, also known as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>There are four objectives of cryptography:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Confidentiality: </b>The information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Integrity: </b>The information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended receiver without the alteration being detected.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Non-repudiation: </b>The creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage their intentions in the creation or transmission of the information.</p>
                            </li><li>
                                <p><b>Authentication: </b>The sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the origin/destination of the information.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>                
            <h1>Two Types of Cryptography</h1>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Symmetric Key encryption</b> or Single-key algorithms use a fixed length of bits known as a block cipher with a secret key between both the creator/sender in order to encrypt and decipher the message. This method is more commonly used because the keys are easier to set up and faster compared to an asymmetric key. Thus making it more preferred for sending large amounts of data. The only downside to this method is that the secret key needs to be shared with the recipient. Although there are precautions taken, like adding a password, in order to keep your information secure, a skilled hacker can brute force the system and will be able to take your information. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Asymmetric Key encryption</b> or Public-key algorithms uses a pair of keys, a public key for the creator/sender to encrypt and a private key that only the originator knows to decrypt the message. The advantage of using Asymmetric encryption is that there are no shared(secret) keys. This adds an extra layer of security. This encryption supports digital signing which authenticates the recipient identity and makes sure that message was not tampered with in transit. The disadvantage is that this encryption is time-intensive and demands a significant amount of effort. You can only send an encrypted email after the other person has created key pairs. Not only that, but also if you lose your private key, it is gone forever. Private keys are irrecoverable and will only cause more problems. </p>
