            <h1>What is Bash?</h1>
                <p> Bash is the shell.</p>

                <p>A shell program is typically an executable binary that takes commands that you type and (once you hit return), translates those commands into system calls to the Operating System API. Through this, bash can read and execute commands from a file. This is called a shell script. Similar to Bash's predecisor and descendant Unix shells, it supports command substitutions, filename globbing (wildcard matching), here documents, piping, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. </p>
                
            <h1>Bash Scripting</h1>
                <p>One of the reasons Bash is so strong is that it can be scripted. Meaning that you can list everything from Bash in a plain-text file and have Bash run the commands for you. Compared to spending a whole day manually running a hundred commands, you can now script them and have your computer run them automatically while you finish other tasks. What makes bash even more amazing is that almost everything on Linux can run and scripted through Bash. </p>

            <h1>Basic Bash Commands</h1>
                 <p><b>[ ]</b>: Anything encased in [ ] means that it's optional. Some commands can be used without options or specifying files.</p>

                <p><b>ls - List directory contents</b>: Allows you to view all files within the specified directory</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Syntax: ls [option(s)][file(s)]</li>
                        <li>Common options: -a, -l</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                <p><b>echo - Prints text to the terminal window</b>: typically used to show the output status text to the screen or computer file. It is also used for showing the values of environmental variables, which tell the shell how to behave as a user works at the command line or in scripts.</p>

                </ul>

                <p><b>touch - Creates a file</b>: Used to create new files, change timestamps on files and/or directories. You can create as many files as you want in a single command without worrying about overwriting files with the same name. </p>
