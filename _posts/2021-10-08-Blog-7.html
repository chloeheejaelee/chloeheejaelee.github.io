            <h1>What is SSL?</h1>
                <p>SSL is short for Secure Sockets Layer and it is what keeps everyone’s internet connection secure. It is standard technology used for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers.It helps keep any sensitive data that is being transferred between two systems protected. This helps prevent any data from being stolen, mishandled or redistributed from the original data. It keeps the data secure by using an encryption algorithm to scramble data in transit, preventing hackers from reading it as it is sent over the connection. The three things that SSL provides when it comes to security is: Encryption, Authentication, and Data Integrity.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Encryption: </b>Encryption safeguards data communications by scrambling data so that only authorized parties may decipher it. The process of turning plaintext to ciphertext is known as encryption. This signifies that the procedure converts legible data into a random format. Encryption necessitates the use of an encryption key, which is a set of formulaic values that are known by both the sender and receiver of an encrypted message. Despite its appearance of randomness, encrypted data follows a logical, predictable pattern, allowing the party receiving the encrypted data to decrypt it back into plaintext with the key used to encrypt it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Authentication: </b>Authentication verifies that the server to which we are connecting is the one to which we were attempting to connect. A server and a user are involved in every web interaction. The majority of people regularly post sensitive and personal information on the internet. As a result, persons and websites are at risk. As a result, better authentication satisfies important legal security criteria. Stable, verifiable, and secure user interactions are required. This is accomplished by gathering data about each user. Basic authentication, form–based authentication, and SSL authentication are examples of different types of authentication.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Data Integrity: </b>During all processing, data integrity ensures that information is accurate and consistent. It also refers to the safety and security of data in terms of regulatory compliance. During the design phase, numerous processes, rules, and standards are developed to guarantee data integrity. Information kept in a database will stay complete, accurate, and reliable regardless of how long it has been held or how often it is viewed if data integrity is maintained. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h1>What is an SSL Certificate?</h1>
                <p>An SSL certificate is a sort of digital certificate that enables an encrypted connection by providing the authentication required by a website. These certificates are used to communicate between a client and a server. This method is frequently used on e–commerce sites and websites that need users to input any type of personal information. This is intended to assist prevent hackers from stealing private information by ensuring that all data exchanged between the two parties remains private and safe. As a result, an SSL certificate is used to verify that the supplier is who they say they are and to signify safe connections between personal devices and websites. This method helps keep customers keep their trust with websites and to maintain that their information is kept secure from malicious activity. </p>
