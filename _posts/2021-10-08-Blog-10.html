            <h1>What are LAMP Stacks?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>LAMP is also an open source web application that is short of a time-tested stack of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. As for stack, it stands for “solution stack.” When these stacks are packed together, it forms a platform. On this platform, it supports all kinds of applications softwares. This makes it so that when different programs work together, they allow developers to create a database-driven and dynamic website.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Developers choose the LAMP stack because it makes deployment easier and allows for customization. Since LAMP is open source, it is a commonly used application to make the cost of development cheaper while making user’s websites perform better. Due to the fact that it is highly used, the application has gained popularity and now has a large community that allows source code to be shared and available for anyone.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>                
            <h1>LAMP’s Architecture</h1>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Linux: </b>Known as the backbone for the LAMP stacks, Linux is actually the first layer that all the other components run on. Since the other components happen to all work together through Linux, it is used as the main component for the stacks. Linux is the obvious choice because it is also open source and has the ability to be flexible and easy to configure options compared to other operating systems. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Apache: </b>Apache is also a free, open-source web server that runs off of Linux. Apache is also popular as it is used for half of the websites on the Internet. It works using the HTTP to process requests and transmit information over the Internet. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>MySQL: </b>MySQL facilitates the creation of dynamic databases by supporting SQL and relational tables. When you need to alter website material frequently, have a lot of user-contributed information, rely on user feedback, or have a lot of content that has to be stored and retrieved, MySQL is a good choice. MariaDB is another MySQL-compatible database that allows users to effortlessly move their databases between different structures with little risk. MySQL has a number of advantages, including data security, on-demand scalability, fast performance, and more.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>PHP: </b>The last layer of the LAMP stack is the programming language. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming language that sits on top of this layer and combines all of the LAMP stack's components. It enables web applications to run smoothly. PHP is a scripting language that interacts with Apache to create dynamic web pages. HTML can't be used to run dynamic processes by itself. To get data from a database, it requires a programming language like PHP. PHP implemented this functionality by simply inserting PHP code into the dynamic elements of a page.</p>
