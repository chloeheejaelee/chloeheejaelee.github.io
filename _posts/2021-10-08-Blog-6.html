            <h1>What is AWS?</h1>
                <p>AWS stands for Amazon Web Services and it is the most popular cloud platform offering over 200 services from data centers globally. AWS was launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle it’s online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model. This helped other companies and businesses grow to scale without the worry of maintaining extra costs of hardware and software.</p>
            <h1>AWS Services</h1>
                <p>AWS has different services that can each specialize for different features to accommodate the user’s needs. Here are some of the services that are offered.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2): </b>A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 is essentially a Virtual Machine that can scale instances. EC2 also enables customers to create apps that scale automatically in response to changing needs and peak periods, as well as make it simple to install virtual servers and manage storage, reducing the need for hardware and speeding up development. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS): </b>Helps operate a relational database in the cloud. Of course, relational databases work using a relational model. The relational model is a way of organizing data that uses tables with columns and rows, similar to what you'd find in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>AWS Lambda: </b>A Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code without provisioning or managing servers. This lets you virtually run code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically moves the execution power and runs your code at a demand of the incoming request for any scale of traffic. Basically meaning you can set it so that the user’s code can run on over 200 AWS services and over applications.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS): </b>SQS is a fully maintained message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, serverless applications, and distributed systems. SQS simplifies the management of operating message-oriented middleware, and helps the users focus back into differentiating work. SQS is used to send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>AWS CloudTrial: </b>CloudTrial is a service that provides visibility into user activity by recording API calls made on your account. CloudTrial records important information about each API call, including the name of the API, the identity of the caller, the time of the API call, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service. This helps track the AWS resources so that the user may be able to accurately troubleshoot operational issues. It also makes it easier to ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory standards. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
