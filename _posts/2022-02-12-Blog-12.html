            <h1>What is Angular?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source JavaScript framework. It's run by Google, and its major goal is to create single-page applications. Angular has evident advantages as a framework, and it also provides a common structure for developers to work with. It allows users to construct huge applications that are easy to manage. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>                
            <h1>Anuglar Features</h1>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>1. Document Object Model</b> Regular DOM is used by Angular. Consider a scenario in which ten changes are made to the same HTML page. Angular will update the full tree structure of HTML tags, rather than just the ones that have previously been modified.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>2. TypeScript</b> TypeScript is a set of types for JavaScript that lets users write more understandable JavaScript code. All TypeScript code may be compiled with JavaScript and run on any platform. The use of TypeScript is not required while creating an Angular application. It is, nevertheless, highly encouraged because it improves syntactic structure and makes the codebase easier to comprehend and maintain.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>3. Data Binding</b> Data binding is a web browser feature that allows users to alter web page elements. It makes use of dynamic HTML and does not necessitate any scripting or programming. Data binding is a technique used in web sites with interactive elements like calculators, tutorials, forums, and games. When a web page has a big amount of data, it also allows for a better incremental display. The two-way binding is used by Angular. Any modifications made to the associated UI components are reflected in the model state. The UI state, on the other hand, represents any changes in the model state. The framework can use this functionality to connect the DOM to the model data via the controller.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>4. Testing</b> The Jasmine testing framework is used by Angular. The Jasmine framework has a number of features that can be used to create various types of test scenarios. Karma is the test task-runner that uses a configuration file to configure the start-up, reporters, and testing framework. If you want to work with Angular on a regular basis, you need to comprehend its architecture now that you're familiar with its core capabilities. You may also learn concepts like TypeScript, Bootstrap Grid System, dependency injections, SPA, forms, pipes, promises, observables, and Angular class testing by enrolling in the Angular Certification Training Course.</p>
