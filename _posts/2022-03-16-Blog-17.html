            <h1>What is MAC? </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Mac (short for Macintosh) is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Inc. (originally as Apple Computer, Inc.) since January 1984. While at first they used Windows, they then started to create their own operating system around 1988 called, Macintosh System Software. Soon calling it "Mac OS" in 1997 with the release of Mac OS 7.6, and retrospectively called "Classic Mac OS". Apple produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh called A/UX from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not license macOS for use on non-Apple computers, however, System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Apple thenreleased Mac OS X in 2001, a modern Unix-based operating system that was later renamed OS X in 2012 and macOS in 2016. Its final version was macOS Catalina, with macOS Big Sur following in 2020. MacOS Monterey is the current version, which was originally published on June 7, 2021. [6] With the help of Boot Camp or third-party software, Intel-based Macs can run native third-party operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Microsoft Windows. (A similar accomplishment has been performed on Apple's ARM-based technology, but it necessitates an operating system designed specifically for it.) Volunteer communities have modified Intel-based macOS to run on non-Apple devices without permission.</p>

                        <p>In the States, MACs are favorable to the public but there are some downsides to it as well. Here are the pros and cons.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>                
            <h1>Advantages</h1>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Fewer virus attacks:</b> Compared to windows users, there are fewer macOS users which makes it less likely for a virus attack. Another reason is that the UNIX is more secure than Windows OS. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Good customer support:</b> Mac users are more satisifyed with Apple's customer support team. Apple hires skilled engineers that have quick response times for both hardware and software issues.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Similar GUI for all the products:</b> MacOS has the same graphical user interface (GUI) as other Apple products. Which makes it more easily understandble on mutiple different apple products for the public.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Performance and long life:</b> Apple computers are known to have better quality products. Their computers have a longer life than others.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Default apps:</b> When you install Windows, it comes with pre-installed software that slow down your computer, for example, Onedrive. This is not the case with macOS, which includes sophisticated apps that do not degrade your system's speed. iPhoto and iMovie are two of the pre-installed macOS programs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Support NTFS and FAT:</b> macOS support windos file system formats including both NTFs and FAT.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Can run Windows:</b> You can run the Windows operating system if you have macOS installed by using Bootcamp or parallels software.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Expensive:</b> The minimum cost of a Mac PC is higher than $1000. You can get a good Windows PC at $1000 wwith more hardware specification. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Fewer games and software:</b> Most game developers prefer to create games on the Windows operating system since it has a larger user base. There are fewer games accessible for Mac users. Furthermore, Mac computers have limited graphical capabilities, making it difficult for them to run high-resolution games. Some software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, is only available for Windows users and not for Mac users.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>No hardware cuustomization:</b> You cannot modify the physical components of a Mac computer or laptop, such as the processor or graphics card. You can alter the hardware and RAM on some Mac computers, but not all Mac machines. Other hardware attachments, such as internal computer parts, are similarly not replaceable; your only option is to purchase a new Mac machine. You must upgrade your computer with each major release of your operating system, or 50 percent of your operating system's functionality will stop working.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Windows cannot read the macOS file system:</b> macOS can read NTFS and FAT Windows format but Windows cannot read the macOS file system. You need to install 3rd party software in Windows to do so. Some other software like footnotes has compatibility issues while moving files from macOS to Windows.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Less hardware used:</b> The new version of macOS computer supports less USB ports and they also not shipped with CD/DVD writer.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
