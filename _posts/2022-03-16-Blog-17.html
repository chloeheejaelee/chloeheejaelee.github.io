            <h1>START HERE </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>React makes creating interactive UIs a breeze. Create basic views for each state of your project, and React will update and render the appropriate components as your data changes. Declarative views improve the predictability and debugability of your code. It builds isolated components that handle their own state and then assembles them into complicated user interfaces. You can simply transmit rich data through your app and keep state off of the DOM because component functionality is written in JavaScript rather than templates. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>                
            <h1>Why React?</h1>
               <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Easy production of dynamic online applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications by requiring less coding and providing more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, which can quickly become difficult.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>React leverages Virtual DOM, which speeds up the development of web apps. Instead of updating all of the components again, as traditional web applications do, Virtual DOM examines the components' prior states and updates only the objects in the Real DOM that have changed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Components are the building parts of any React application, and a single app is typically made up of numerous components. These components have their own logic and controls, and they can be reused across the program, reducing the development time significantly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A unidirectional data flow is followed by React. As a result, developers frequently nest child components within parent components when developing a React app. Because data flows in a single path, debugging faults and determining where a problem arises in an application at any given time becomes easier.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>React has a short learning curve since it mixes core HTML and JavaScript concepts with some useful enhancements. Still, like with other technologies and frameworks, you'll need to devote some effort to fully comprehending React's library.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It can be used to create both web and mobile applications: We already know that React is used to create web applications, but that's not all it can accomplish. React Native is a popular framework that is derived from React itself and is used to create stunning mobile applications. React may therefore be used to create both web and mobile applications.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Debugging tools that are dedicated to the task: A Chrome extension for debugging React applications has been released by Facebook. Debugging React web applications becomes much faster and easier as a result of this.</p>
                    </li>
